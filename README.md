## Notes

- It is required to use [dxlevel 90](https://docs.mastercomfig.com/latest/customization/launch_options/?h=#dxlevel-launch-options) or higher.
- You might have issues with injecting if you are on Windows 10 upgraded from Windows 7.
- The source code is sometimes detected, use [VAC Bypass by danielkrupinski](https://github.com/Fedoraware/VAC-Bypass-Loader/releases/tag/Release). In the event you get VAC banned, you will look like a retard. cheat on accounts you care about.
- Read the [Fedoraware Documentation](https://fedoraware.github.io/Docs/) to learn more about Fedoraware and its features.

- **If you have any problems, you can open an [issue](https://github.com/SalmonDev/SalmonPaste/issues) so we can safely ingore you.**
