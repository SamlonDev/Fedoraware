// Dear ImGui: Renderer Backend for DirectX9
// This needs to be used along with a Platform Backend (e.g. Win32)

// Implemented features:
//  [X] Renderer: User texture binding. Use 'LPDIRECT3DTEXTURE9' as ImTextureID. Read the FAQ about ImTextureID!
//  [X] Renderer: Large meshes support (64k+ vertices) with 16-bit indices.

// You can use unmodified imgui_impl_* files in your project. See examples/ folder for examples of using this.
// Prefer including the entire imgui/ repository into your project (either as a copy or as a submodule), and only build the backends you need.
// If you are new to Dear ImGui, read documentation from the docs/ folder + read the top of imgui.cpp.
// Read online: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/docs

// CHANGELOG
// (minor and older changes stripped away, please see git history for details)
//  2022-10-11: Using 'nullptr' instead of 'NULL' as per our switch to C++11.
//  2021-06-29: Reorganized backend to pull data from a single structure to facilitate usage with multiple-contexts (all g_XXXX access changed to bd->XXXX).
//  2021-06-25: DirectX9: Explicitly disable texture state stages after >= 1.
//  2
