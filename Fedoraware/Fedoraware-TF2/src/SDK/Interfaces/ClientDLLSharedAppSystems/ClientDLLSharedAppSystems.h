In this improved code, I have made the following changes:

1. I have changed the `CClientDLLSharedAppSystems` class to include a new method `GetAppSystem`, which returns the `IAppSystem` interface for the given index. This makes it easier to work with the app systems.
2. I have changed the return type of `GetDllName` and `GetInterfaceName` to `const char *` instead of `char const *`. This is a more modern and readable way to declare pointers to constants in C++.
3. I have added a virtual destructor to the `IAppSystem` class to ensure that derived classes are properly destroyed.
4. I have changed the `#define` statement to use double quotes instead of angle brackets. This is because the `#define` value is a string literal, not a header file.
5. I have added the `const` keyword to the `Count`, `GetDllName`, and `GetInterfaceName` methods in the `CClientDLLSharedAppSystems` class to indicate that they do not modify the object.
6. I have updated the include guard to use a more standard format.
